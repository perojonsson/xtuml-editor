modifications, revisions, copies, documentation and design data
(&quot;Software&quot;) are copyrighted, trade secret and confidential
information of Mentor Graphics or its licensors, who maintain exclusive title
to all Software and retain all rights not expressly granted by this Agreement.
Mentor Graphics grants to Customer, subject to payment of applicable license
fees, a nontransferable, nonexclusive license to use Software solely: (a) in
machine-readable, object-code form (except as provided in Subsection 5.2); (b)
for Customer's internal business purposes; (c) for the term of the license; and
(d) on the computer hardware and at the site authorized by Mentor Graphics. A
site is restricted to a one-half mile (800 meter) radius. Customer may have
Software temporarily used by an employee for telecommuting purposes from
locations other than a Customer office, such as the employee's residence, an
airport or hotel, provided that such employee's primary place of employment is
the site where the Software is authorized for use. Mentor Graphics' standard
policies and programs, which vary depending on Software, license fees paid or
services purchased, apply to the following: (a) relocation of Software; (b) use
of Software, which may be limited, for example, to execution of a single
session by a single user on the authorized hardware or for a restricted period
of time (such limitations may be technically implemented through the use of
authorization codes or similar devices); and (c) support services provided,
including eligibility to receive telephone support, updates, modifications, and
revisions. For the avoidance of doubt, if Customer provides any feedback or
requests any change or enhancement to Products, whether in the course of
receiving support or consulting services, evaluating Products, performing beta
testing or otherwise, any inventions, product improvements, modifications or
developments made by Mentor Graphics (at Mentor Graphics' sole discretion) will
be the exclusive property of Mentor Graphics.</span></p>

nonexclusive license to reproduce and distribute executable files created using
ESC compilers, including the ESC run-time libraries distributed with ESC C and
C++ compiler Software that are linked into a composite program as an integral
part of Customer's compiled computer program, provided that Customer
distributes these files only in conjunction with Customer's compiled computer
program. Mentor Graphics does NOT grant Customer any right to duplicate,
incorporate or embed copies of Mentor Graphics' real-time operating systems or
other embedded software products into Customer's products or applications
without first signing or otherwise agreeing to a separate agreement with Mentor
Graphics for such purpose.</span></p>

Graphics grants to Customer a temporary, nontransferable, nonexclusive license
for experimental use to test and evaluate the Beta Code without charge for a
limited period of time specified by Mentor Graphics. Mentor Graphics may
choose, at its sole discretion, not to release Beta Code commercially in any

malfunctions or suggested improvements. Upon completion of Customer's
evaluation and testing, Customer will send to Mentor Graphics a written
evaluation of the Beta Code, including its strengths, weaknesses and

necessary to support the authorized use. Each copy must include all notices and

Graphics or its licensors. Customer shall maintain a record of the number and
primary location of all copies of Software, including copies merged with other

request. Customer shall not make Products available in any form to any person
other than Customer's employees and on-site contractors, excluding Mentor

obligations of confidentiality. Customer shall take appropriate action to
protect the confidentiality of Products and ensure that any person permitted
access does not disclose or use Products except as permitted by this Agreement.
Customer shall give Mentor Graphics written notice of any unauthorized
disclosure or use of the Products as soon as Customer becomes aware of such
unauthorized disclosure or use. Except as otherwise permitted for purposes of
interoperability as specified by applicable and mandatory local law, Customer shall
not reverse-assemble, reverse-compile, reverse-engineer or in any way derive
any source code from Software. Log files, data files, rule files and script
files generated by or for the Software (collectively &quot;Files&quot;),

Mentor Graphics' trade secret and proprietary syntaxes for expressing process
rules, constitute or include confidential information of Mentor Graphics. Customer
may share Files with third parties, excluding Mentor Graphics competitors,
provided that the confidentiality of such Files is protected by written
agreement at least as well as Customer protects other information of a similar
nature or importance, but in any case with at least reasonable care. Customer
may use Files containing SVRF or TVF only with Mentor Graphics products. Under
no circumstances shall Customer use Products or Files or allow their use for
the purpose of developing, enhancing or marketing any product that is in any
way competitive with Products, or disclose to any third party the results of,

with the delivery of (a) Software updates or (b) authorization codes or

owners of certain Mentor Graphics intellectual property licensed under this
Agreement are located in Ireland and the U.S. To promote consistency around the
world, disputes shall be resolved as follows: excluding conflict of laws rules,
this Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State
of Oregon, U.S., if Customer is located in North or South America, and the laws
of Ireland if Customer is located outside of North or South America. All
disputes arising out of or in relation to this Agreement shall be submitted to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Portland, Oregon when the laws of
Oregon apply, or Dublin, Ireland when the laws of Ireland apply.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, all disputes in Asia arising out of or in
relation to this Agreement shall be resolved by arbitration in Singapore before
a single arbitrator to be appointed by the chairman of the Singapore
International Arbitration Centre (&quot;SIAC&quot;) to be conducted in the

effect at the time of the dispute, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by
reference in this section. Nothing in this section shall restrict Mentor
Graphics' right to bring an action (including for example a motion for
injunctive relief) against Customer in the jurisdiction where Customer's place
of business is located. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
